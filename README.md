# SE8R01-stm8-weight-send

this uses the hx711 and a Weighing scale to measure the weight of a person 

the result is transmitted with a nrf24 similar module (the cheapest I could find, but it was not compatible, so had to adapt the code-- it is in fact a se8R01 module)


on the receiving side there is an orange pi single board computer -- see in opi-serial-to-mysql for the code
